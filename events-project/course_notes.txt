1. React framework composed of components. 
2. All the elements that is given with <> </> are considered as react fragments. 
3. And if react fragment does not contain props such as parameters it is not necessary to include <React.Fragment> </React.Fragment>
but if it contains props such as parameters it is necessary to include <React.Fragment> </React.Fragment>. 
4. <div> </div> are also react fragments.
5. This is children props (h2,p,a): 
        <Modal>
            <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Dolorem esse explicabo, suscipit fuga incidunt nam maxime voluptatem alias blanditiis placeat eius numquam facere mollitia sed? Eum fugiat corrupti id repudiandae!</p>
            <a href="google.com">read more...</a>
        </Modal>

        and we can include them: 

        export default function Modal(props) {
        return (
            <div className="modal-backdrop">
                <div className="modal">
                    {props.children} // <- inlcuding all props at once.
                </div>
            </div>
                )
        }

6. ReactDOM.createPortal (portals) is a method provided by React that allows you to render a React component at a different place in the DOM tree than where it is defined in the component hierarchy.
7. Note that not only index.css or App.css are global, but also other component specific stylesheets are also global.
